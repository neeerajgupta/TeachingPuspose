HAS-A relationship:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. HAS-A relationship is also known as composition (or) aggregation.
2. There is no specific keyword to implement HAS-A relationship but mostly we 
   can use new operator.
3. The main advantage of HAS-A relationship is reusability


Composition  :
-------------------------------
Without existing container object if there is no chance of existing contained objects then 
the relationship between container object and contained object is called composition 
which is a strong association


Aggregation:
-------------------------------
Without existing container object if there is a chance of existing contained objects such 
type of relationship is called aggregation. In aggregation objects have weak association.
